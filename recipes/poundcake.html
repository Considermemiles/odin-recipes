           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <p></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 
                    10-inch tube pan; line with parchment paper.</li><p></p>

                <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric 
                    mixer until light and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time, 
                    beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract. 
                    Beat in peanut butter slowly.</li><p></p>

                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix into 
                    the butter mixture, a little at a time, until batter is well blended. 
                    Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.</li><p></p>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes. 
                    Sprinkle peanuts on top. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F 
                    (165 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the 
                    center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li><p></p>

                <li>Cool cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let 
                    cool completely.</li><p></p>
            </ol>
